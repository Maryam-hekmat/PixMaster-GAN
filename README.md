# PixMaster-GAN
PixMaster-GAN 📌  This notebook implements a Pix2Pix GAN for converting maps to realistic images.  Includes data preprocessing, Generator &amp; Discriminator architecture, training loop, and evaluation.



Building Images Dataset 🏢

This notebook uses a dataset of building images, designed for training image-to-image translation models such as Pix2Pix GAN.

Dataset Details:

All input images are stored in the read-only ../input/ directory.

Each image may represent different building types, architectures, or layouts.

The images can be used for tasks like map-to-image translation, super-resolution, or image generation.
